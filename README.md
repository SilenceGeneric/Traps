## Honeypot Network Setup Script

This script sets up a honeypot network, which is a system that is designed to attract and collect data from attackers. The honeypot network in this script consists of the following components:

* Honeyd: A network security monitor that can be used to simulate a real system.

* Cowrie: A honeypot SSH server that can be used to collect data from attackers who attempt to log in to the server.

* Dionaea: A honeypot that can be used to collect data from attackers who attempt to exploit vulnerable services.

* Nginx: A web server that can be used to serve the honeypot logs.

* Kismet: A wireless network detector that can be used to monitor the honeypot network for attacks.

To use this script, you will need to have the following installed:

* Python 3

* The following Python modules:

    * os

    * sys

    * subprocess

    * time

* The following system packages:

    * honeyd

    * cowrie

    * dionaea

    * nginx

    * kismet-ng

Once you have installed all of the required software, you can run the script by typing the following command:

```

python3 setup_honeypot.py

```

The script will first check to see if all of the required dependencies are installed. If any dependencies are missing, the script will print an error message and exit.

If all of the dependencies are installed, the script will proceed to update the system and install the necessary honeypot components. Once the honeypot components are installed, the script will configure and start them.

Once the honeypot network is up and running, the script will print a message indicating that the honeypot is up and running.

## Usage

To use the honeypot network, simply connect to the honeypot network using the IP address of the honeypot server. The honeypot server will respond with a banner that indicates that it is a honeypot.

The honeypot will log all of the interactions with the attacker. This data can be used to analyze the attacker's behavior and to identify the attacker's tools and techniques.
